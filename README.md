# KangPythonExamBIO539
A repo for Exam 4 (Python) for BIO 539 Spring 2023

## Files 

 - KangPythonExam.ipynb - unedited Jupyter notebook where each question on the exam was worked through step-by-step with documentation; includes sections where problems were re-done as I learned new things while progressing through the exam 

 - KangObservedSubstrings.py - a Python script that outputs sequences and counts for the number of observed substrings of length k for sequence data stored in a text file 
 
    -  Terminal input formatted [python KangObservedSubstrings.py sequence.txt k] where sequence.txt holds the user's sequence data (no breaks) and k is the length of the substring

 - KangPossibleSubstrings.py - a Python script that outputs the number of possible substrings of length k for sequence data stored in a text file

    - Terminal input formatted [python KangPossibleSubstrings.py sequence.txt k] where sequence.txt holds the user's sequence data (no breaks) and k is the length of the substring

- KangLinguisticComplexity.py - a Python script which outputs the linguistic complexity of sequence data stored in a text file 
    
    - Terminal input formatted [python KangLinguisticComplexity.py sequence.txt] where sequence.txt holds the user's sequence data (no breaks)

- examplesequence.txt - a text file with example sequence data used to test py scripts
